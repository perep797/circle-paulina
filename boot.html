        <p>
             Having read some of Steven Levy's <i>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</i>, I came into the Bardini reading expecting something similar since it covers an adjacent scene to the <cite>MIT railroad club and Berkeley/Silicon Valley 1970s group.</cite> Instead, I found the writing style to be more technically focused and dense than Hackers. The underground (-ish, as much as it can be when the US government is involved) collaborative feeling of these early developers is still present here, but the focus of the text seems to be less on the community and more on the technology being developed. I recognize that techincal language is necessary to describe why this technology was so exciting, however I think it's possible for the author to balance both <small>engagment and preciseness</small>.

             Are there any other ways the author could have made the text more engaging without sacrficing accuracy?

            Probably not. This Bardini guy seems <strong>insufferable</strong> and not too into editing. Especially near the end when it became five pages of transcripts from like four different sources. And he just kinda threw them together? Didn't bother editing those for the written paper readers sake? <i>Cool</i>. 

            poll: was larry real?
